Documentation of the Provided Pages
===================================

All pages contain links to items and achievements.  In those links, an item's
[rarity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rarity) is indicated with the
official colors.  Links conduct searches in the [Guild Wars 2
Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page).  For transmuted items, the
skin name is displayed but the original name is used in the search.  Numbers in
parentheses are item identifiers with links to
[GW2Spidy](https://www.gw2spidy.com/).
